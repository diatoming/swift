  "61": "When a country obtains great power,\nit becomes like the sea:\nall streams run downward into it.\n\nThe more powerful it grows,\nthe greater the need for humility.\n\nHumility means trusting the Tao,\nthus never needing to be defensive. \n\nA great nation is like a great man:\nWhen he makes a mistake, he realizes it.\n\nHaving realized it, he admits it.\nHaving admitted it, he corrects it.\n\nHe considers those who point out his faults\nas his most benevolent teachers.\n\nHe thinks of his enemy\nas the shadow that he himself casts. \n\nIf a nation is centered in the Tao,\nif it nourishes its own people\nand doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,\nit will be a light to all nations in the world.\n",
  "62": "The Tao is the center of the universe,\nthe good man's treasure,\nthe bad man's refuge. \n\nHonors can be bought with fine words,\nrespect can be won with good deeds;\nbut the Tao is beyond all value,\nand no one can achieve it. \n\nThus, when a new leader is chosen,\ndon't offer to help him\nwith your wealth or your expertise.\n\nOffer instead\nto teach him about the Tao. \n\nWhy did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?\nBecause, being one with the Tao,\nwhen you seek, you find;\nand when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.\n\nThat is why everybody loves it.\n",
  "63": "Act without doing;\nwork without effort.\n\nThink of the small as large\nand the few as many.\n\nConfront the difficult\nwhile it is still easy;\naccomplish the great task\nby a series of small acts. \n\nThe Master never reaches for the great;\nthus she achieves greatness.\n\nWhen she runs into a difficulty,\nshe stops and gives herself to it.\n\nShe doesn't cling to her own comfort;\nthus problems are no problem for her.\n",
  "64": "What is rooted is easy to nourish.\nWhat is recent is easy to correct.\n\nWhat is brittle is easy to break.\nWhat is small is easy to scatter. \n\nPrevent trouble before it arises.\nPut things in order before they exist.\n\nThe giant pine tree\ngrows from a tiny sprout.\n\nThe journey of a thousand miles\nstarts from beneath your feet. \n\nRushing into action, you fail.\nTrying to grasp things, you lose them.\n\nForcing a project to completion,\nyou ruin what was almost ripe. \n\nTherefore the Master takes action\nby letting things take their course.\n\nHe remains as calm\nat the end as at the beginning.\n\nHe has nothing,\nthus has nothing to lose.\n\nWhat he desires is non-desire;\nwhat he learns is to unlearn.\n\nHe simply reminds people\nof who they have always been.\n\nHe cares about nothing but the Tao.\nThus he can care for all things.\n",
  "65": "The ancient Masters\ndidn't try to educate the people,\nbut kindly taught them to not-know. \n\nWhen they think that they know the answers,\npeople are difficult to guide.\n\nWhen they know that they don't know,\npeople can find their own way. \n\nIf you want to learn how to govern,\navoid being clever or rich.\n\nThe simplest pattern is the clearest.\n\nContent with an ordinary life,\nyou can show all people the way\nback to their own true nature.\n",
  "66": "All streams flow to the sea\nbecause it is lower than they are.\n\nHumility gives it its power. \n\nIf you want to govern the people,\nyou must place yourself below them.\n\nIf you want to lead the people,\nyou must learn how to follow them. \n\nThe Master is above the people,\nand no one feels oppressed.\n\nShe goes ahead of the people,\nand no one feels manipulated.\n\nThe whole world is grateful to her.\n\nBecause she competes with no one,\nno one can compete with her.\n",
  "67": "Some say that my teaching is nonsense.\n\nOthers call it lofty but impractical.\n\nBut to those who have looked inside themselves,\nthis nonsense makes perfect sense.\n\nAnd to those who put it into practice,\nthis loftiness has roots that go deep. \n\nI have just three things to teach:\nsimplicity, patience, compassion.\n\nThese three are your greatest treasures.\n\nSimple in actions and in thoughts,\nyou return to the source of being.\n\nPatient with both friends and enemies,\nyou accord with the way things are.\n\nCompassionate toward yourself,\nyou reconcile all beings in the world.\n",
  "68": "The best athlete\nwants his opponent at his best.\n\nThe best general\nenters the mind of his enemy.\n\nThe best businessman\nserves the communal good.\n\nThe best leader\nfollows the will of the people. \n\nAll of them embody\nthe virtue of non-competition.\n\nNot that they don't love to compete,\nbut they do it in the spirit of play.\n\nIn this they are like children\nand in harmony with the Tao.\n",
  "69": "The generals have a saying:\n\"Rather than make the first move\nit is better to wait and see.\nRather than advance an inch\nit is better to retreat a yard.\" \n\nThis is called\ngoing forward without advancing,\npushing back without using weapons. \n\nThere is no greater misfortune\nthan underestimating your enemy.\n\nUnderestimating your enemy\nmeans thinking that he is evil.\n\nThus you destroy your three treasures\nand become an enemy yourself. \n\nWhen two great forces oppose each other,\nthe victory will go\nto the one that knows how to yield.\n",
  "70": "My teachings are easy to understand\nand easy to put into practice.\n\nYet your intellect will never grasp them,\nand if you try to practice them, you'll fail. \n\nMy teachings are older than the world.\n\nHow can you grasp their meaning? \nIf you want to know me,\nlook inside your heart.\n",
  "71": "Not-knowing is true knowledge.\n\nPresuming to know is a disease.\n\nFirst realize that you are sick;\nthen you can move toward health. \n\nThe Master is her own physician.\n\nShe has healed herself of all knowing.\n\nThus she is truly whole.\n",
  "72": "When they lose their sense of awe,\npeople turn to religion.\n\nWhen they no longer trust themselves,\nthey begin to depend upon authority. \n\nTherefore the Master steps back\nso that people won't be confused.\n\nHe teaches without a teaching,\nso that people will have nothing to learn.\n",
  "73": "The Tao is always at ease.\n\nIt overcomes without competing,\nanswers without speaking a word,\narrives without being summoned,\naccomplishes without a plan. \n\nIts net covers the whole universe.\n\nAnd though its meshes are wide,\nit doesn't let a thing slip through.\n",
  "74": "If you realize that all things change,\nthere is nothing you will try to hold on to.\n\nIf you aren't afraid of dying,\nthere is nothing you can't achieve. \n\nTrying to control the future\nis like trying to take the master carpenter's place.\n\nWhen you handle the master carpenter's tools, \nchances are that you'll cut your hand.\n",
  "75": "When taxes are too high,\npeople go hungry.\n\nWhen the government is too intrusive,\npeople lose their spirit. \n\nAct for the people's benefit.\nTrust them; leave them alone.\n",
  "76": "Men are born soft and supple;\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\n\nPlats are born tender and pliant;\ndead, they are brittle and dry. \n\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\nis a disciple of death.\n\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life. \n\nThe hard and stiff will be broken.\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\n",
  "77": "As it acts in the world, the Tao\nis like the bending of a bow.\n\nThe top is bent downward;\nthe bottom is bent up.\n\nIt adjusts excess and deficiency\nso that there is perfect balance.\n\nIt takes from what is too much\nand give to what isn't enough. \n\nThose who try to control,\nwho use force to protect their power,\ngo against the direction of the Tao.\n\nThey take from those who don't have enough\nand give to those who have far too much.\n\nThe Master can keep giving\nbecause there is no end to her wealth.\n\nShe acts without expectation,\nsucceeds without taking credit,\nand doesn't think that she is better\nthan anyone else.\n",
  "78": "Nothing in the world\nis as soft and yielding as water.\n\nYet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,\nnothing can surpass it. The soft overcomes the hard;\nthe gentle overcomes the rigid.\n\nEveryone knows this is true,\nbut few can put it into practice. \n\nTherefore the Master remains\nserene in the midst of sorrow.\n\nEvil cannot enter his heart.\n\nBecause he has given up helping,\nhe is people's greatest help. \n\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n",
  "79": "Failure is an opportunity.\n\nIf you blame someone else,\nthere is no end to the blame. \n\nTherefore the Master\nfulfills her own obligations\nand corrects her own mistakes.\n\nShe does what she needs to do\nand demands nothing of others.\n",
  "80": "If a country is governed wisely,\nits inhabitants will be content.\n\nThey enjoy the labor of their hands\nand don't waste time inventing\nlabor-saving machines.\n\nSince they dearly love their homes,\nthey aren't interested in travel.\n\nThere may be a few wagons and boats,\nbut these don't go anywhere.\n\nThere may be an arsenal of weapons,\nbut nobody ever uses them.\n\nPeople enjoy their food,\ntake pleasure in being with their families,\nspend weekends working in their gardens,\ndelight in the doings of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd even though the next country is so close\nthat people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,\nthey are content to die of old age\nwithout ever having gone to see it.\n",
  "81": "True words aren't eloquent;\neloquent words aren't true.\n\nWise men don't need to prove their point;\nmen who need to prove their point aren't wise. \n\nThe Master has no possessions.\nThe more he does for others,\nthe happier he is.\n\nThe more he gives to others,\nthe wealthier he is. \n\nThe Tao nourishes by not forcing.\nBy not dominating, the Master leads.\n"
